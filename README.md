    👋 Hi, I’m @Amaan0101
    👀 I’m interested in unraveling the mysteries of the digital universe and creating quirky coding concoctions.
    🌱 I’m currently learning how to speak binary and mastering wweb development frameworks.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make people go "Wow!" and "What even is that?!" simultaneously.
    📫 How to reach me: Drop a message in a bottle and toss it into the nearest internet ocean, or you can email me at your.email@example.com.
    😄 Pronouns: Byte/Bite
    ⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote a program so efficient, it made my toaster jealous.
